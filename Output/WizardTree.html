You quickly tell your co-worker to dial emergency services, and are just about to help out the secretary when you see a small metallic orb next to her head. Reaching out to touch it, it starts glowing a pale blue hue. There is no sign of the orb having hit the secretary, but there are a few shards of glass stuck in her arm. This seems like the source of the blood on the floor; there are no other cuts to be seen. An ambulance arrives to take care of the victim.

You've had a few cases where bad things really hit the fan, and you do not want to be held accountable if someone does something that crashes a server or other critical infrastructure.

What appears to be a flame shines from within, a warm flame that burns confidently, like a small child eager to start off on an adventure of a lifetime. Suddenly, the orb becomes red hot to touch and starts glowing with an intense white light. You drop the orb. Turning around, you notice something odd. The bystanders on the street, they just stand there, frozen. Cars are slowing down, and a kid points up to the office building you just left and drops his jaw in awe. Turning to the building, you immediately notice that an entire floor has its outer walls covered in an inch of ice, and the frost seems to be spreading quickly. Meanwhile, the fiery orb, now on the ground, glows brighter than ever and seems to be reacting with the tarmac on which it lies.</em></p><ul>

Seconds later, an emergency escape door just a few feet a way from you bursts open, and hundreds of gallons of water flood out of the door.

The stairs are typical for what an outdoors emergency escape might look like - metal grid stairs moving in a spiral upwards around a pole. It seems strange to you that someone would place a staircase of this design inside a building, but you quickly realize that had it not been for the grid design of the stairs, there would be no stairs here as they would have collapsed under the weight of the water. You decide to climb the stairs a few floors until you find an open door that seems to have been charred from the inside. Entering through the remaining door frame, you suddenly find yourself in the familiar room where the secretary was injured less than an hour earlier. Or so you thought. It was the same room, indeed, but everything had been rearranged - chairs and desks had been placed next to the walls, the glass shards were long gone, and there was water all over the floor. It seemed immediately obvious that the massive wave of water that had burst open the emergency exit had also rearranged the layout of the room.</em></p>
<p><em>You notice that the air around you is humid; and your immediate thought is to save the computer equipment that might still be here. You find none. In fact, apart from the desks and chairs, the only things remaining are two orbs - an orange and a blue one. They are about two feet apart from one another. Underneath the orange orb, the water sizzles and boils, and underneath the blue one, there is a chunk of solid ice. In the middle between them, the air seems distorted, like air immediately above dark surfaces on a warm, sunny day. A kind of fog, barely visible, seems to float between the orbs as well, kind of like a force field meant to keep them apart. You blow a breath of air towards the fog, and it dissipates, only to be formed again moments later.</em></p>
<p><em>Turning around again, you decide to inspect the wall you came from. An eerie, chilly feeling descends upon you as you look at what remains on the wall. A couple of paintings, a washed down poster of some comic, probably xkcd, and a broomstick approximately 5 feet in length.</em></p><ul>

You get up and dash towards the staircase, and practically fly downwards and escape from the door at the bottom. You don't manage to run far before you hear a massive explosion, and turn around to see a massive beacon light bursting through the roof, straight upwards, towards the sun. Confused, you jump into your car and drive home. The drive home takes just under 15 minutes. Before you go inside, you take another look where you came from, and the beacon light is focused, like a laser, towering higher than you can possibly imagine. You go inside. A mere two minutes later, a violent flash of light erupts outside, and the light outside starts fading. Less than half a minute later, it is completely dark outside.

There isn't exactly a lot to do down here in the dark, anyway, so why not just take the risk? You go around to the front door and knock on the door. From the inside, you can hear footsteps approaching. The door opens, and as soon as the orc spots you, he instinctively grabs his sword and shield from the door, and yells, "Who are you, who dare enter the mighty realm of the Klaod People?!" Taken aback by his forceful aggression, you stumble backwards and trip over a rock. Ending up on your back, the orc puts his sword to your throat while you desperately explain the situation. Your friends hide around the corner, so far having gone unnoticed by the orc.</em></p>
<p><em>"We are adventurers from above," you explain, shivering and cold sweating under your fear for being killed. "We intend no harm. We ended up down here after falling into a cave in our basement." With slow movements, you slide your knife carefully away. "When we first found this cave, we were curious, so we went down to explore. Not knowing where to go or what to do, we went to the only house with lights in it. That's how we ended up here. We do not intend any harm." "How many are you?" the orc asks. "Four in total. But one decided against going down here, so we are three down here." You motion for the others to come. They slowly walk into the light, carefully putting their weapons on the ground. "Very well," the orc says, motioning for you to enter.</em></p>
<p><em>You find yourself around the table inside the house. It is a relatively small space, but the orc has found some extra chairs for the three of you, and you sit down with him. He has brought your weapons and equipment inside, so they lie safely on the floor inside the door. The orc pours some soup for you, and you thank him and start eating. Delicious, it is, the soup. It has been a while since your last proper meal, so you are very glad to have been accepted into the orc's home. You look around and study the interior of the room. The orc's daughter is out of sight.</em></p>
<p><em>"Allow me to introduce myself," the orc starts. "My name is Vlorg. I am of the guardian force. Sorry for scaring you when you got here. We are a bit wary of foreigners around here, you see. A dark history has brought us to where we are today. A long, long time ago, hundreds of years back, this society used to thrive. We were a powerful people, we were skilled miners, and we prospered like never before. Back in the day, our people were the ones who dug out this hall," Vlorg says, motioning towards the window. "All that changed the day the dwarves attacked."</em></p>
<p><em>"Dwarves?" you inquire. "Yes. What we did not know when we built this place was that far beneath us, miles underground, there was a dwarven people. The folklore has it that they were threatened by our presence. We do not know for sure. All we know is that one day, the guards raised the alarm, and not even had we managed to draw our weapons before the dwarves were upon us. Thousands, they were. Raging, they went full on attack mode on us. We lost many people that day." Vlorg sheds a tear. "Normally, people think of orcs as evil creatures, but the truth is, we have been too preoccupied by the dwarves to bother declaring war against any other people. Had it not been for the fact that we are at war with the dwarves, you would not be alive right now." Vlorg's face takes on a disgruntled look.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Great Invasion, as we call it, lasted for days. Most of them came on the first day, but after three days, we were still fighting. We did our best to defend the city, but some soldiers made it past our barricades and lit fire to our homes, and crushed everything in their path. Families were brutally murdered. Children wandered the streets, both parents dead. It was mayhem, chaos everywhere. We are still attacked now and then, but nothing as bad as that fateful day. We never fully recovered, Only a few of us are left long, and I am afraid it won't be long before we leave either."</em></p>
<p><em>"Where would you go?" you asked. "Where did the others go?" "To Utharia," Vlorg responded. "It is an orc nation far to the north of here. None of us want to go, really. We know that if we go there, we will be taken as slaves. The people of Utharia hate foreigners, and hardly anyone who have gone have made it back alive. They all tell the same story - they were taken as slaves, forced to work under inhumane conditions, in shivering cold and blazing heat, pulling heavy loads of gold and silver from the mines down below. It is a terrible place to go to, but many still left because all they had ever fought for back here had been lost anyway. The only way to win would be to fight the dwarves, but even going near the entrance to their secret lair is suicide. We have sent people before, but nobody have returned. Once, we received a wooden box with a white powder. Most likely, it was the ground down bones of one of our soldiers. It is really terrible. We feel helpless, there is nothing we feel we can do." Vlorg starts sobbing quietly.</em></p><ul>

We imagine that if we somehow manage to kill off the queen, we could actually be within reach of winning the war. But the dwarves know all of us; an orc isn't exactly hard to recognize.

We managed to capture this from one of the dwarves not long after the war. Some drunk soldier who had wandered into our realm, looking pretty unfit for a fight. We quickly eliminated him and took it." The mithril shirt glitters in the light. "You can have it if you want, but beware that the dwarves know that we took it from them. If you go down there wearing this, they may as well recognize you as an enemy and take you down. Only dwarves are supposed to have access to this stuff, hardly anyone even knows it exists. They normally wear another garment or armor of some kind on top of it to hide it. It makes them look much weaker than they are." Vlorg hands you the mithril shirt. It is very light.</em></p>
<p><em>"The sword was also carried by that soldier. It is of very high quality, at least compared to anything we've ever made. Many of the dwarves used this type of weapon in the war."

Over the years, we have collected vast amounts of gold, which we use to build statues and trade with other people. We have built up wealth. However, long ago, the orcs made for a threatening presence. We had no choice but to attack them.

We were ready for war when we became aware of the orcs' presence. After the first war, we lost a lot of men, but we have since rebuilt. Our army grew to its former size, and keeping the orcs at bay from then on was an easy task. Most of the common miners do not care much about the situation.
