You go around to the front door and knock on the door. From the inside, you can hear footsteps approaching. The door opens, and as soon as the orc spots you, he instinctively grabs his sword and shield from the door, and yells, \"Who are you, who dare enter the mighty realm of the Klaod People?!\" Taken aback by his forceful aggression, you stumble backwards and trip over a rock. Ending up on your back, the orc puts his sword to your throat while you desperately explain the situation. Your friends hide around the corner, so far having gone unnoticed by the orc.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"We are adventurers from above,\" you explain, shivering and cold sweating under your fear for being killed. \"We intend no harm. We ended up down here after falling into a cave in our basement.\" With slow movements, you slide your knife carefully away. \"When we first found this cave, we were curious, so we went down to explore. Not knowing where to go or what to do, we went to the only house with lights in it. That's how we ended up here. We do not intend any harm.\" \"How many are you?\" the orc asks. \"Four in total. But one decided against going down here, so we are three down here.\" You motion for the others to come. They slowly walk into the light, carefully putting their weapons on the ground. \"Very well,\" the orc says, motioning for you to enter.</em></p>\n<p><em>You find yourself around the table inside the house. It is a relatively small space, but the orc has found some extra chairs for the three of you, and you sit down with him. He has brought your weapons and equipment inside, so they lie safely on the floor inside the door. The orc pours some soup for you, and you thank him and start eating. Delicious, it is, the soup. It has been a while since your last proper meal, so you are very glad to have been accepted into the orc's home. You look around and study the interior of the room. The orc's daughter is out of sight.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" the orc starts. \"My name is Vlorg. I am of the guardian force. Sorry for scaring you when you got here. We are a bit wary of foreigners around here, you see. A dark history has brought us to where we are today. A long, long time ago, hundreds of years back, this society used to thrive. We were a powerful people, we were skilled miners, and we prospered like never before. Back in the day, our people were the ones who dug out this hall,\" Vlorg says, motioning towards the window. \"All that changed the day the dwarves attacked.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Dwarves?\" you inquire. \"Yes. What we did not know when we built this place was that far beneath us, miles underground, there was a dwarven people. The folklore has it that they were threatened by our presence. We do not know for sure. All we know is that one day, the guards raised the alarm, and not even had we managed to draw our weapons before the dwarves were upon us. Thousands, they were. Raging, they went full on attack mode on us. We lost many people that day.\" Vlorg sheds a tear. \"Normally, people think of orcs as evil creatures, but the truth is, we have been too preoccupied by the dwarves to bother declaring war against any other people. Had it not been for the fact that we are at war with the dwarves, you would not be alive right now.\" Vlorg's face takes on a disgruntled look.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The Great Invasion, as we call it, lasted for days. Most of them came on the first day, but after three days, we were still fighting. We did our best to defend the city, but some soldiers made it past our barricades and lit fire to our homes, and crushed everything in their path. Families were brutally murdered. Children wandered the streets, both parents dead. It was mayhem, chaos everywhere. We are still attacked now and then, but nothing as bad as that fateful day. We never fully recovered, Only a few of us are left long, and I am afraid it won't be long before we leave either.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Where would you go?\" you asked. \"Where did the others go?\" \"To Utharia,\" Vlorg responded. \"It is an orc nation far to the north of here. None of us want to go, really. We know that if we go there, we will be taken as slaves. The people of Utharia hate foreigners, and hardly anyone who have gone have made it back alive. They all tell the same story - they were taken as slaves, forced to work under inhumane conditions, in shivering cold and blazing heat, pulling heavy loads of gold and silver from the mines down below. It is a terrible place to go to, but many still left because all they had ever fought for back here had been lost anyway. The only way to win would be to fight the dwarves, but even going near the entrance to their secret lair is suicide. We have sent people before, but nobody have returned. Once, we received a wooden box with a white powder. Most likely, it was the ground down bones of one of our soldiers. It is really terrible. We feel helpless, there is nothing we feel we can do.\" Vlorg starts sobbing quietly.</em></p>",

This is the fourth time in one hour that they call you about the database rights. \"Do we have access yet?\" they beg into the handset. \"We need you to grant access yesterday.\" You are tired of their begging. You wish you could make them stop. And at that very moment, a massive feeling of drowsiness hits you, and you promptly fall asleep.</em></p>\n<p><em>You don't know for how long you slept. All you know is that now it is dark outside, and you can't seem to recall where you are or how you got there. Sitting by a desk, you decide to look around, and it is with horror that you discover management circled around you, and fearing the worst, you decide against speaking. You merely acknowledge your wakefulness. The developer team's project leader speaks first, followed by your boss and the rest of management. You don't listen to much of what they say. However, one thing strikes your attention. For some reason, in some way, you have manage to finish off where the development team started.</em></p>",
