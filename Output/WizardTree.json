You decide to climb the stairs a few floors until you find an open door that seems to have been charred from the inside. Entering through the remaining door frame, you suddenly find yourself in the familiar room where the secretary was injured less than an hour earlier. Or so you thought. It was the same room, indeed, but everything had been rearranged - chairs and desks had been placed next to the walls, the glass shards were long gone, and there was water all over the floor. It seemed immediately obvious that the massive wave of water that had burst open the emergency exit had also rearranged the layout of the room.*\n\n*You notice that the air around you is humid; and your immediate thought is to save the computer equipment that might still be here. You find none. In fact, apart from the desks and chairs, the only things remaining are two orbs - an orange and a blue one. They are about two feet apart from one another. Underneath the orange orb, the water sizzles and boils, and underneath the blue one, there is a chunk of solid ice. In the middle between them, the air seems distorted, like air immediately above dark surfaces on a warm, sunny day. A kind of fog, barely visible, seems to float between the orbs as well, kind of like a force field meant to keep them apart. You blow a breath of air towards the fog, and it dissipates, only to be formed again moments later.*\n\n*Turning around again, you decide to inspect the wall you came from. An eerie, chilly feeling descends upon you as you look at what remains on the wall.

He yells in your face, \"Who are you, who dare enter my house, guardian of the mighty realm of the Klaod People?!\" Taken aback by his forceful aggression, you freeze on the ground, and the orc puts his sword to your throat while you desperately explain the situation. /u/LordTardus remains back at the hill where he was attacked by the creature, unaware of what is happening.*\n\n*\"We are adventurers from above,\" you explain, shivering and cold sweating under your fear for being killed. \"We intend no harm. We are just curious, we do not mean to disturb you, we are so sorry. We ended up down here after falling into a cave in our basement.\" The orc stares into your eyes. \"When we first found this cave, we were curious about what would hide in the dark, so we went down to explore the tunneling caverns. We spotted a house with lights in it, thinking it was some sort of geothermal illumination. That's how we ended up here. We do not intend any harm. We didn't think anyone were home.\" \"How many are you?\" the orc asks. \"Two, but my friend is over there.\" You motion the hill where /u/LordTardus remains. The orc does not seem happy.*\n\n*\"If you come meaning no harm, why then do you just mindlessly enter my house? Is it not clear than when there are lights on, there has to be someone at home?\" \"Sorry,\" you say, repeating your explanation that lava could have lit it up. \"Lava at these shallow depths?\" the orc inquires. \"Rubbish. You were well aware that I was here. Even more frightening is the fact that you so openly think you can get away with lying to an orc. And what is this thing on your arms? Blood?!\" The orc sniffs at your hand. \"Orc blood! By gods, you are no better than the filthy dwarves! You shall be punished for this!\" The orc carries you into a stone room and locks the door. There is an open window with metal bars; the whole room looks like a prison cell. You hear a commotion outside, and not long after, /u/LordTardus is thrown into the cell with you. Hours pass before silence eventually falls outside. You try to open the door, but it won't budge.*",

The sound seems to come from some house near the edge of a large city. As you land, you spot an orc girl inside the house. She has not noticed you yet. The girl is curled up on the floor. To the right of the room, there is what looks like a metal cage with outer stone walls. Keys are already inserted into the open door. There is also a table in the main room, surrounded by a selection of stone chairs. The main entrance to the house is wide open, suggesting that someone left in a hurry. Footsteps lead into some tunnels, but the tunnels branch in all directions. It is impossible to figure out where they went, whoever they were, just by looking for footsteps.*",

A sudden glow strikes her eyes, and not long after, she's grasping between the bars of the metal cage, trying to grab the rest of the plate of chocolate. Looking across the room, you spot a key.*\n\n*\"Hey, little friend,\" you say, \"see that keyring over there? If you can give it to me, you'll get this bar of chocolate from me!\" She looks at you with prying eyes, more fixated on the chocolate than you. She does not appear to understand your words. Frantically, you point back and forth between the keys and the chocolate, but she still does not react. She is too young. Had she been just months older, she might have fetched the keys, you think, but just as you are about to give up, she goes across the room and grabs the keys. \"Good girl!\" you tell her, but just as you are about to give her the chocolate, she snatches it out of your hand and keeps both the keys and chocolate for herself. \"Clever.

The orc girl starts screaming, and you have to grab whatever you can take and flee from the house. Behind you, you can hear footsteps as the orc is now awake and running towards you at great speed. You are running too slow, so you have to throw away your weapons. After running for a while, you entered a tunnel network more akin to a giant maze. Finally, after running left and right for who knows how long, you turn around and notice that the orc is no longer following you. You all sit down, exhausted, and in silence, hoping that the orc doesn't lurk nearby. After an hour, you have all started chatting with each other, and you are eager to go on with the adventure.

There isn't exactly a lot to do down here in the dark, anyway, so why not just take the risk? You go around to the front door and knock on the door. From the inside, you can hear footsteps approaching. The door opens, and as soon as the orc spots you, he instinctively grabs his sword and shield from the door, and yells, \"Who are you, who dare enter the mighty realm of the Klaod People?!\" Taken aback by his forceful aggression, you stumble backwards and trip over a rock. Ending up on your back, the orc puts his sword to your throat while you desperately explain the situation. Your friends hide around the corner, so far having gone unnoticed by the orc.*\n\n*\"We are adventurers from above,\" you explain, shivering and cold sweating under your fear for being killed. \"We intend no harm. We ended up down here after falling into a cave in our basement.\" With slow movements, you slide your knife carefully away. \"When we first found this cave, we were curious, so we went down to explore. Not knowing where to go or what to do, we went to the only house with lights in it. That's how we ended up here. We do not intend any harm.\" \"How many are you?\" the orc asks. \"Four in total. But one decided against going down here, so we are three down here.\" You motion for the others to come. They slowly walk into the light, carefully putting their weapons on the ground. \"Very well,\" the orc says, motioning for you to enter.*\n\n*You find yourself around the table inside the house. It is a relatively small space, but the orc has found some extra chairs for the three of you, and you sit down with him. He has brought your weapons and equipment inside, so they lie safely on the floor inside the door. The orc pours some soup for you, and you thank him and start eating. Delicious, it is, the soup. It has been a while since your last proper meal, so you are very glad to have been accepted into the orc's home. You look around and study the interior of the room. The orc's daughter is out of sight.*\n\n*\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" the orc starts. \"My name is Vlorg. I am of the guardian force. Sorry for scaring you when you got here. We are a bit wary of foreigners around here, you see. A dark history has brought us to where we are today. A long, long time ago, hundreds of years back, this society used to thrive. We were a powerful people, we were skilled miners, and we prospered like never before. Back in the day, our people were the ones who dug out this hall,\" Vlorg says, motioning towards the window. \"All that changed the day the dwarves attacked.\"*\n\n*\"Dwarves?\" you inquire. \"Yes. What we did not know when we built this place was that far beneath us, miles underground, there was a dwarven people. The folklore has it that they were threatened by our presence. We do not know for sure. All we know is that one day, the guards raised the alarm, and not even had we managed to draw our weapons before the dwarves were upon us. Thousands, they were. Raging, they went full on attack mode on us. We lost many people that day.\" Vlorg sheds a tear. \"Normally, people think of orcs as evil creatures, but the truth is, we have been too preoccupied by the dwarves to bother declaring war against any other people. Had it not been for the fact that we are at war with the dwarves, you would not be alive right now.\" Vlorg's face takes on a disgruntled look.*\n\n*\"The Great Invasion, as we call it, lasted for days. Most of them came on the first day, but after three days, we were still fighting. We did our best to defend the city, but some soldiers made it past our barricades and lit fire to our homes, and crushed everything in their path. Families were brutally murdered. Children wandered the streets, both parents dead. It was mayhem, chaos everywhere. We are still attacked now and then, but nothing as bad as that fateful day. We never fully recovered, Only a few of us are left long, and I am afraid it won't be long before we leave either.\"*\n\n*\"Where would you go?\" you asked. \"Where did the others go?\" \"To Utharia,\" Vlorg responded. \"It is an orc nation far to the north of here. None of us want to go, really. We know that if we go there, we will be taken as slaves. The people of Utharia hate foreigners, and hardly anyone who have gone have made it back alive. They all tell the same story - they were taken as slaves, forced to work under inhumane conditions, in shivering cold and blazing heat, pulling heavy loads of gold and silver from the mines down below. It is a terrible place to go to, but many still left because all they had ever fought for back here had been lost anyway. The only way to win would be to fight the dwarves, but even going near the entrance to their secret lair is suicide. We have sent people before, but nobody have returned. Once, we received a wooden box with a white powder. Most likely, it was the ground down bones of one of our soldiers. It is really terrible. We feel helpless, there is nothing we feel we can do.\" Vlorg starts sobbing quietly.*",

The dwarves are many, and they all follow the orders of their Queen Yokheda. We imagine that if we somehow manage to kill off the queen, we could actually be within reach of winning the war.

A mithril armor piece and a sword. We managed to capture this from one of the dwarves not long after the war. Some drunk soldier who had wandered into our realm, looking pretty unfit for a fight. We quickly eliminated him and took it.\" The mithril shirt glitters in the light. \"You can have it if you want, but beware that the dwarves know that we took it from them. If you go down there wearing this, they may as well recognize you as an enemy and take you down. Only dwarves are supposed to have access to this stuff, hardly anyone even knows it exists. They normally wear another garment or armor of some kind on top of it to hide it. It makes them look much weaker than they are.\" Vlorg hands you the mithril shirt. It is very light.*\n\n*\"The sword was also carried by that soldier. It is of very high quality, at least compared to anything we've ever made. Many of the dwarves used this type of weapon in the war.\" You inspect the sword. \"We have swords like that where we come from, too,\" you tell him. \"I figured so,\" Vlorg replies. \"But I don't think your swords have runic inscriptions like these.\" He motions to some inscriptions on the hilt and blade of the sword. \"It is up to you if you want it, but beware that if the dwarves notice that it is theirs, they will not take it kindly.\"*",

However, long ago, the orcs made for a threatening presence. We had no choice but to attack them.

It is a long way from here, but we have a long railway that helps us bring stuff back and forth,\" Thakhuki says. \"Over time, we managed to build up a powerful army. We were ready for war when we became aware of the orcs' presence. After the first war, we lost a lot of men, but we have since rebuilt. Our army grew to its former size, and keeping the orcs at bay from then on was an easy task. Most of the common miners do not care much about the situation. They just keep up their normal activities, pretending like nothing is happening. I guess they have more important matters to worry about.\"*",

Nevertheless, curiosity's grip on you finally wins, and you touch the orbs.*\n\n*Pain. Crippling, unfathomable pain. The only thing you can sense as your hands encase the orbs is the horror of what happens within, what hides there within your fist as you struggle to open them, to let the orbs fall out, let this pain go. But you fail. Your left hand is frozen through, skin turning a dark blue color. Your right hand is on fire, and it doesn't look very pretty. In desperation, you knock your arms against the wall in the hope that the orbs will fall out, but to no avail. Unable to handle any more pain, you pass out.*\n\n*You do not know how long you were unconscious, much less how you survived. What you do know is that you are alive. Looking down at your hands, you find none. Your lower arms are both amputated. You scream for help, but none arrives, not even a whisper of a reply is heard. Looking around you, you find you are in a small hospital room. A beeping machine to your left. The room is otherwise empty, except for your bed and a door.
